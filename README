Lingua::RU::Charset - Perl extension for detecting and converting 
various russian character sets: KOI8-r, Windows-1251, CP866, ISO-8859-5, 
X-Mac-Cyrillic, russian text in english letters, russian part of Unicode 
and UTF-8. This module can be especially useful for computers with broken 
cyrillic locales (like foreign web hosts).

This module does not use locale or unicode and is written in pure Perl, 
so it will probably work at any computer.

You can install this module as usual: 

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

For some strange reason the installation into local directories with 
"perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/some/dir" does not work. If you know 
the reason - please drop me a mail at alex@kawo2.rwth-aachen.de (Till 
it's fixed, you can still copy the Charset.pm manually into Lingua/RU/ ).
